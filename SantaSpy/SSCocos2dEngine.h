/**
 * This singleton encapsulates the cocos2d engine to make it easier
 * for my app to manage.  When the singleton is initialized, the
 * cocos2d engine is initialized.  When it is cleaned up,
 * cocosd is cleaned up.  When it is paused or resumed,
 * cocos2d is pasued/resumed.  
 *
 * The cocos2d view that is generated is specialized for this app.
 * For instance, the background is transparent, and it fits this
 * app's window size and orientation.
 *
 * This engine sets up the cocos2d director and EAGLView, but
 * it does not create or run a scene.
