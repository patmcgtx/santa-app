An augmented-reality Santa-finding app released years ago as [Where in the World is Santa Claus?](https://www.roundtripsoftware.com/app/santa/).

Camera view with sensor-reactive animation layered on top.  Localized into eight languages.  

Coded in Objective-C with UIKit and cocos2d.  This was way before [RealityKit](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/), [SpriteKit](https://developer.apple.com/spritekit/), or even [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/). ðŸ˜‰
